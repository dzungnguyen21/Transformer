# Transformer-based Text Processing

## Overview
This project implements a **Transformer model** for advanced **text processing and classification** tasks. The model utilizes **self-attention mechanisms** to improve contextual understanding in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** applications. It is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

## Features
- Implements **Transformer architecture** from scratch.
- Utilizes **self-attention** for better text representation.
- Supports **text classification tasks**.
- Optimized with **PyTorch** for efficient model training and inference.
- Can be extended to other **NLP tasks** such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentiment Analysis.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** on text classification tasks.
- Effective in handling **long-range dependencies** in text.
- Performs well compared to traditional NLP models.

## Future Improvements
- Integrating **pretrained Transformer models** (BERT, GPT) for transfer learning.
- Extending to **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Question Answering** tasks.
- Optimizing training using **distributed computing**.
